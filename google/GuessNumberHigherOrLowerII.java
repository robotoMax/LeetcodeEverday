 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you 
 * guess the number 
 * 
 * I picked.
 * Example:
 * n = 10, I pick 8.
 * First round:  You
 *  guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 * Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 * Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 * Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 * You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

/**
 * finding the maximum out of the minimum costs of its left and right segments
 * the method is similar to number of distinct tree.
 * 
 * For each number x in range[i~j]
 * we do: result_when_pick_x = x + max{DP([i~x-1]), DP([x+1, j])}
 * --> // the max means whenever you choose a number, the feedback is always bad and therefore leads you to a worse branch.
 * then we get DP([i~j]) = min{xi, ... ,xj}
 * --> // this min makes sure that you are minimizing your cost.
